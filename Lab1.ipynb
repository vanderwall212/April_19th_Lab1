Our examples so far have made use of the `print()` command and the `input()` command.\n\nStandard input and output are really only useful for simple communications using very short messages. In the typical case in analyzing large data we need to use `file input` and `file output`.\n\nThe `open()` command above creates a sort of pipe between the operating system of the computer, which can access and modify files stored on disk, and the python program.\n\nWhen it does this the command creates a **file object**.
